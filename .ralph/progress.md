# BrandKit MCP remediation progress

Append-only execution record. A story is complete only when its acceptance
criteria and the global regression gate have objective evidence here.

## 2026-08-28 23:15 EDT — BASE-001

- Objective: Capture a reproducible remediation baseline and persist the Ralph controller state.
- Defect reproduced: The existing production dependency audit exits nonzero with 11 findings: 6 high, 4 moderate, and 1 low. A full install reports 17 findings including 1 critical development advisory.
- Changes: Added the authoritative remediation PRD, loop prompt, append-only progress log, failure log, and discovered-bug registry.
- Files changed: `.ralph/PROMPT.md`, `.ralph/remediation-prd.json`, `.ralph/progress.md`, `.ralph/failures.md`, `.ralph/discovered-bugs.json`.
- Verification commands: `jq empty`, `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm audit --omit=dev --json`, `npm pack --dry-run --json`, `git diff --check`.
- Verification results: JSON valid; install, typecheck, lint, 190 tests, build, package dry run, and diff check pass. Audit failure is captured by DEP-002 and is not waived.
- Security review: All original critical and high review findings are represented as failing stories.
- Compatibility review: No runtime source or public behavior changed.
- Remaining risks: All implementation stories remain open.
- Rollback: Revert the baseline-state commit; runtime behavior is unaffected.
- Commit: Pending at time of entry.
- Next eligible story: BASE-002.
